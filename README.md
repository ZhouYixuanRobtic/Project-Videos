This repository shows several selected videos (click figures below to see the videos) for my projects.
## Rubber Tapping Robot

  The rubber tapping robot aims at automatically accomplishing rubber tapping operation. The robot contains a mobile base, a 6-DOF manipulator, and multiple sensors (3D LIDAR, RGBD Camera, IMU, etc). The robot can automatically navigate to desired positions and accomplish tapping operation automatically, according to the tag.
